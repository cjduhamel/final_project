In some cases this is done by considering the theory at geometric singularities and in others by considering a configuration containing branes and then taking a limit where the dynamics on the brane decouples from the bulk. \n\nIn this paper we consider theories that are obtained by decoupling theories on branes from gravity. We focus on conformal inv",
